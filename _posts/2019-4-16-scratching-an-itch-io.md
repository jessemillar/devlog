In the name of getting some community traction behind *The Staff of Lewis* prior to release, I'm moving all future devlog posts relating to *The Staff of Lewis* to [the *The Staff of Lewis* itch.io devlog](https://compycore.itch.io/the-staff-of-lewis). And general devlog updates not specific to *The Staff of Lewis* will still be here and I'll still be posting announcements for new devlog posts [on my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/jessemillar). Let's get this project moving!
