Tweaked drawing and bounding boxes to have offset for easier mental modeling of position (x,y,z position is now true position instead of top-left)
Got coin collecting working
Tweaked depth-sorted drawing to better show height because skellies were confusing when they jumped on top of each other (couldn't tell which one was on the shoulders of another)
Improved textboxes with a typing sound and hand-drawn pixel portraits
Made GIF capture work
	- Removing because it doesn't work on retina displays and because colors were off thanks to the 256 color limit of the GIF file format
	- Need to find an external program that can record decently
		- Gonna use Gifox because it has great control of final image compression and colors
Making skelly smarter (still buggy, but runs to a spot near the player and then throws)
