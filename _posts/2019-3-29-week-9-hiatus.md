My wife and I started house shopping recently and that's been an all-time-consuming endeavor. I've managed to get a few things done though and hope to get back in the swing of things in the near future and also some exciting news! I started fiddling with Unity over the last few weeks (perhaps a bit of a mistake because now I want a lot of Unity features in my *The Staff of Lewis* engine) and it resulted in a tiny prototype of a game I've been wanting to make for a couple years. I'm looking forward to finishing *The Staff of Lewis* so I can start in on some of these new ideas! GIF of the prototype below!

Getting back to *The Staff of Lewis*, here's a gameplay GIF with some of the recent changes.
