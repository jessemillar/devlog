This isn't quite the beginning for this project. December 1, 2016 was actually my first commit to this project's repository.

I wanna take game dev more seriously because I've been missing having a creative outlet.

Originally, The Staff of Lewis was being written in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). The vision for the project outgrew the limitations of the PICO-8 fantasy console. With this latest creative push, I've moved to the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) game engine. LÖVE has been great so far. I love having access to community libraries like [hump](https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Bump](https://github.com/oniietzschan/bump-3dpd). PICO-8 exists to be minimal which largely results in hand-written "libraries" specific to each game. The few projects I've made in PICO-8 were super fun to build but took a long while because I had to build from scratch. LÖVE has helped me move quicker. I've managed to port most of the previous functionality from the PICO-8 version of The Staff of Lewis to LÖVE in less than a month with cleaner code to boot.

My plan is to have this game finished by April 1st, 2019 (no, this isn't an April Fool's joke) with weekly devlog update posts between now and then.

[Talk about the concept]

I want to publish a larger-than-PICO-8 game but also fight feature creep so the three month deadline is attainable.

First steps are to finish porting what I had engine-wise from PICO-8 to LÖVE. Not everything has to be perfect, but it needs to be playable for playtesting and organized enough that development can proceed after the MVP at a quick pace.

The next step is to  craft an MVP with a single player with a couple attacks, movement, and an enemy that's smart (maybe that runs behind the player).

My plan is to force myself to focus on one game at a time. It's going to be interesting to limit myself like that. Dabbling in multiple projects is what's gotten me in trouble in the past so I want to avoid that pitfall if possible. The downside is that I already have a somewhat solid idea in mind for my next game that I'm pretty excited about.

Now that I've [finished and formally published](https://jessemillar.itch.io/) three of my older game projects, I can start with a clean slate on The Staff of Lewis.
