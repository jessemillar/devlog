This isn't quite the beginning for this project.

December 1, 2016 was actually my first commit to this project's repository.

I wanna take game dev more seriously because I've been missing having a creative outlet.

Originally, The Staff of Lewis was being written in PICO-8. The vision for the project outgrew the limitations of the PICO-8 fantasy console. With this latest creative push, I've moved to the LÖVE game engine. LÖVE has been great so far. I love having access to community libraries like Hump and Bump [check spelling]. PICO-8 exists to be minimal which largely results in hand-written "libraries" specific to each game. The few projects I've made in PICO-8 were super fun to build but took a long while because I had to build from scratch. LÖVE has helped me move quicker. I've managed to port most of the previous functionality from the PICO-8 version of The Staff of Lewis to LÖVE in less than a month with cleaner code to boot.

My plan is to have this game finished by March [pick specific date] with weekly (potentially bi-weekly) devlog update posts.

I want to publish a larger-than-PICO-8 game but also fight feature creep so the three month deadline is attainable.

First steps are to finish porting what I had engine-wise from PICO-8 to LÖVE. Not everything has to be perfect, but it needs to be playable for playtesting and organized enough that development can proceed after the MVP at a quick pace.

The next step is to  craft an MVP with a single player with a couple attacks, movement, and an enemy that's smart (maybe that runs behind the player).

My plan is to force myself to focus on one game at a time. It's going to be interesting to limit myself like that. Dabbling in multiple projects is what's gotten me in trouble in the past so I want to avoid that pitfall if possible. The downside is that I already have a somewhat solid idea in mind for my next game that I'm pretty excited about.
