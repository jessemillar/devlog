It's been three weeks since my last post. In the interest of full disclosure, I've had enough content for a new post for the last two weeks. I put off writing this installment because it was just too darn tempting to keep pushing because I'm THIS CLOSE to a working MVP. I've decided it's finally time to publish a new post even though the MVP isn't quite ready. Hopefully there'll be a demo next week!
